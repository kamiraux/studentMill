Presentation and objectives
---------------------------

This is a system to execute automatically a test suite on a set of students.

The following functionnalities are available:

- Isolation of students from each other and from the system

- Configuration file for a project

- Complete architecture for tests:

  - Set of compilation units: if the student code has to be compiled several
    way.

  - Set of test units: a set of tests may refer to a test unit, this avoid
    rewriting the same thing several times.

  - A set of test data: the test data may be put in this set in order to be
    referenced by tests afterwards.




About isolation

Configuration file
------------------

The configuration must expect to be executed in the directory where it is
located (verry important). Every path defined by the variables in this file must
be an absolute path. To use paths relatives to where the configuration file is,
the special variable $PWD should be used.

Example:
    project.config
    my_script.sh

    Content of `project.config`
    #! /bin/sh

    PATH_TO_SCRIPT=$PWD/my_script.sh
